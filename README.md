# catüêà

This is the repository for the ACL 2020 paper embarrassingly simple aspect extraction.
In this work, we extract aspects from restaurant reviews using a new form of attention that uses RBF kernels.

## Requirements

* numpy
* gensim (for training embeddings)
* sklearn
* reach (for reading embeddings and vectorizing sentences)
* pyconll (for reading conll files)
* tqdm
* pandas
* matplotlib

For a list, see `requirements.txt`

## Usage

If you want to apply cat to your data, you need a couple of things.

1. An aspect set, i.e., the set of labels you would like to predict
2. A set of _in-domain_ word embeddings. This is really important, as we show in the paper.
3. A set of aspect terms which you think correspond to the aspects you want to extract.
4. A set of instances for which you want to predict the labels you define in step 1. We expect these to be tokenized, one sentence per line.

If you have all these things, you can simply look at `cat.py` and replace the paths in this file with the paths to the appropriate files/instances.
catüêà has two hyperparameters: the gamma of the kernel, and the aspect words, these also need to be set by hand.

If you do not have access to pre-trained embeddings or aspect words, you will need a parser to extract either nouns or tree fragments.
For maximum portability, we adopt the CoNLLu format, a format that many parsers output.
If you use [spacy](https://spacy.io/), you can use the [spacyconllu](https://github.com/andreasvc/spacyconllu) script.

To obtain the nouns and  run `train_embeddings.py`, and replace the paths with the appropriate paths to your CoNLLu parsed file.
This will train your embeddings and extract the aspect words, which you will need in the next step.

## Reproducing the experiments

You can reproduce the experiments by obtaining the data, putting it in the `/data` folder and running the experiments from `/experiments`.
In the paper, we use the SemEval 2014, 2015 and citysearch dataset, which you can do here:

* [semeval 2014](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/)
* [semeval 2015](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2015/task12/)
* [citysearch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mehrbod/RR/) (we used the link from [this repository](https://github.com/ruidan/Unsupervised-Aspect-Extraction) because this link seems to be broken)

If you tokenize this data and put them in data, the code from `cat.datasets` can simply load the instances.
